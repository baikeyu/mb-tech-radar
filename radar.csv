NoSQL,Standard,Storage and Data Management,FALSE,"A NoSQL (originally referring to ""non-SQL"" or ""non-relational"") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name ""NoSQL"" was only coined in the early 21st century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called Not only SQL to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent architectures.",Added in 2022 Q2
Relational Database,Standard,Storage and Data Management,FALSE,A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database.,Added in 2022 Q2
Object storage,Standard,Storage and Data Management,FALSE,"Object storage (also known as object-based storage) is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manages data as a file hierarchy, and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks. Each object typically includes the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier. Object storage can be implemented at multiple levels, including the device level (object-storage device), the system level, and the interface level. In each case, object storage seeks to enable capabilities not addressed by other storage architectures, like interfaces that are directly programmable by the application, a namespace that can span multiple instances of physical hardware, and data-management functions like data replication and data distribution at object-level granularity.",Added in 2022 Q2
Block storage,Standard,Storage and Data Management,FALSE,"In computing (specifically data transmission and data storage), a block, sometimes called a physical record, is a sequence of bytes or bits, usually containing some whole number of records, having a maximum length; a block size.[ Data thus structured are said to be blocked. The process of putting data into blocks is called blocking, while deblocking is the process of extracting data from blocks. Blocked data is normally stored in a data buffer, and read or written a whole block at a time. Blocking reduces the overhead and speeds up the handling of the data-stream.",Added in 2022 Q2
Network file system,Standard,Storage and Data Management,FALSE,A network file system (NFS) is a type of file system mechanism that enables the storage and retrieval of data from multiple disks and directories across a shared network.

Dremio creates a central data catalog for all the data sources you connect to it. Added in 2022 Q3",Added in 2022 Q3
Data Mesh,Monitor,Storage and Data Management,FALSE,"Data Mesh is an organizational and architectural paradigm for managing Big Data that originated in 2019. It is a process and architectural approach that delegates responsibility for specific data sets to members of a business that have the subject matter expertise to know what the data is supposed to represent and how it should be used. The name Data Mesh comes from Mesh Networking, as this new model is also based on a decentralized architecture and proposes to move beyond a monolithic Data Lake. With Data Mesh, instead of assuming that data will reside in a data lake, each area of business is responsible for choosing how to host and serve the datasets that they own.",Added in 2022 Q2
Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML),Monitor,Storage and Data Management,FALSE,"Machine Learning applications are becoming popular in our industry, however the process for developing, deploying, and continuously improving them is more complex compared to more traditional software, such as a web service or a mobile application. They are subject to change in three axis: the code itself, the model, and the data. Their behaviour is often complex and hard to predict, and they are harder to test, harder to explain, and harder to improve. Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML) is the discipline of bringing Continuous Delivery principles and practices to Machine Learning applications.",Added in 2022 Q2

Microservices,Standard,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"A microservice architecture is to arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The goal is that teams can bring their services to life independent of others. Loose coupling reduces all types of dependencies and the complexities around it, as service developers do not need to care about the users of the service, they do not force their changes onto users of the service",Added in 2022 Q2
API First Design,Standard,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"An API-first approach to building software products means that your organization treats APIs with importance, as reusable and easily accessible that client applications consume. API-first means designing products around an API from the ground up, rather than building a product and adding an API later.",Added in 2022 Q2
Single Page Application (SPA),Standard,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.",Added in 2022 Q2

Micro Frontend,Evaluate,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,Micro frontends are a new pattern where web application UIs (front ends) are composed from semi-independent fragments that can be built by different teams using different technologies. Micro-frontend architectures resemble back-end architectures where back ends are composed from semi-independent microservices.,Added in 2022 Q2
Event-Driven Architecture,Evaluate,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services and is common in modern applications built with microservices. An event is a change in state, or an update, like an item being placed in a shopping cart on an e-commerce website. Events can either carry the state (the item purchased, its price, and a delivery address) or events can be identifiers (a notification that an order was shipped).",Added in 2022 Q2
Enterprise Architecture Development Method,Evaluate,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"The Architecture Development Method – often referred to by its abbreviation as the ADM – is a detailed step-by-step process for developing or changing an enterprise architecture.

Chaos Engineering,Evaluate,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a software system in production in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions. In software development, a given software system's ability to tolerate failures while still ensuring adequate quality of service—often generalized as resiliency—is typically specified as a requirement. However, development teams often fail to meet this requirement due to factors such as short deadlines or lack of knowledge of the field. Chaos engineering is a technique to meet the resilience requirement. Chaos engineering can be used to achieve resilience against infrastructure failures, network failures, and application failures.",Added in 2022 Q2
Remote Procedure Call (RPC),Evaluate,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPCs are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures are largely the same whether they are local or remote, but usually they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.",Added in 2022 Q2
Hexagonal Architecture,Evaluate,Techniques and Patterns,TRUE,"The hexagonal architecture, or ports and adapters architecture, is an architectural pattern used in software design. It aims at creating loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and adapters.

Microservice Integration Patterns,Monitor,Techniques and Patterns,TRUE,"Microservices integration plays a vital role in creating a seamless experience of the system, from the end user’s perspective. Correctly integrated systems also help realize the benefits of distributed systems: They enable scaling at the service level and improve efficiency, and have a potential of reducing the infrastructure costs while serving business needs . On the other hand, incorrectly integrated systems completely undermine the benefits of a microservices architecture: It can result in painful data loss and integrity issues. The problems are usually very hard to track down, and in the meantime, users are impacted adversely. Seamless integration depends on a number of considerations, mapped to Principles for Microservices Integration.",Added in 2022 Q3
Architecture Decision Records (ADR),Monitor,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"In software engineering and software architecture design, architectural decisions are design decisions that address architecturally significant requirements; they are perceived as hard to make and/or costly to change.",
Reactive Programing,Monitor,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,"In computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. With this paradigm, it's possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow.",
Page Composing,Monitor,Techniques and Patterns,FALSE,Page layout or page composition is the process of placing and arranging and rearranging text and graphics on the page. A good composition is one that is not only pleasing to look at but also effectively conveys the message of the text and graphics to the intended audience. There are certain tried and true elements of page composition that can help ensure a successful layout. You may notice that these page composition tips are closely tied to the principles of design.,
Trunk-based Development,Standard,Software Development and Framework,FALSE,"A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ *, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques.
